Simple Factory Pattern is the basic version of Factory Pattern. It's main idea is that decoupling object creating and object utilizing. You need to create the parent abstract class, adding abstract methods. Whereby, you may create a lot of children classes inheriting from the abstract class. And you need also create a factory class to get specific object. But the problem is that you may create too many children classes and hard to extend in factory class.
